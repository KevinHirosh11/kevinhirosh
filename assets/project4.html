            <p>
                This project is a classic Pong game developed entirely using Python and the Pygame library.
                The goal of this project was to strengthen my understanding of game development fundamentals, 
                real-time graphics rendering, and basic artificial intelligence logic within a 2D environment.
                <br><br>
                In this game, the left paddle is controlled by a human player, while the right paddle is controlled by an AI bot. 
                The player uses keyboard inputs to move the paddle up and down, allowing direct and responsive interaction with the game. 
                The AI paddle on the right side is programmed to track the ball's vertical movement and respond accordingly, creating a challenging and engaging opponent.
                The game includes core Pong mechanics such as ball movement, collision detection, paddle physics, and score tracking. 
                Pygame is used to manage the game window, handle events, render graphics, and maintain a consistent frame rate for smooth gameplay. 
                Through this project, I implemented logical conditions to control the AI behavior, ensuring it reacts dynamically rather than moving randomly.
                <br><br>
                This project demonstrates my ability to work with Python programming, apply game logic, and use Pygame to build interactive applications. 
                It also reflects my understanding of problem-solving concepts such as object movement, collision handling, and basic AI decision-making. 
                Overall, this Pong game represents an important step in my journey toward developing more complex and interactive software projects.
