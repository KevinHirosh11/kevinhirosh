            <div class="blender-layer">
                <p>During my time at the University of Moratuwa, I had the opportunity to participate in a workshop conducted by Dr. Susara Thenuvaras, 
                    where I developed a project that combined creativity, technical skill, and scientific visualization. The focus of this project was to design and simulate a solar 
                    system model using Blender for 3D object creation and the Python console for scripting and dynamic simulation.
                    The project began with the construction of celestial objects such as the sun, planets, and moons. Each object was carefully modeled to reflect realistic proportions and textures, 
                    ensuring that the visual representation was both scientifically inspired and aesthetically engaging. Blender's powerful modeling tools allowed me to create a vibrant and immersive environment, 
                    while my attention to detail ensured that the system maintained clarity and educational value.
                    Once the objects were created, I moved into the simulation phase, where Python scripting played a central role. By writing scripts directly in Blender's Python console, 
                    I was able to animate orbital paths, rotations, and other dynamic behaviors that mimic the mechanics of celestial motion. This scripting not only brought the solar system 
                    to life but also demonstrated my ability to integrate programming with visual design. The simulation allowed viewers to observe planetary dynamics in real time, making the project both interactive and informative.
                    Presenting this work during Dr. Thenuvaras' workshop was a valuable experience. It gave me the chance to showcase how technical engineering and creative design can be blended to produce meaningful digital experiences. 
                    The project highlighted my strengths in modular coding, 3D visualization, and interactive environments, while also reflecting my broader interest in building systems that are both functional and engaging.</p>
